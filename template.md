Homework 3
================

## Problem 1

I will open a dataset called **instacart**

*About the data set*

This data set provides buyer data of instacart. There are the following
variabels: order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered,
user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day,
days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id,
aisle, department. Further the number of columns in **instacart** is 15
and the number of observations is 1384617 This dataset could offer
business insight to instacart and its advertisers, like the average hour
of the day, which is 13.5775922 (24 hour format).

## Problem 2

I will open a dataset called BRFSS

I will now format the data to use appropriate variable names and focus
on the overhealth topic

``` r
names(brfss_smart2010)
```

    ##  [1] "Year"                       "Locationabbr"              
    ##  [3] "Locationdesc"               "Class"                     
    ##  [5] "Topic"                      "Question"                  
    ##  [7] "Response"                   "Sample_Size"               
    ##  [9] "Data_value"                 "Confidence_limit_Low"      
    ## [11] "Confidence_limit_High"      "Display_order"             
    ## [13] "Data_value_unit"            "Data_value_type"           
    ## [15] "Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol" "Data_Value_Footnote"       
    ## [17] "DataSource"                 "ClassId"                   
    ## [19] "TopicId"                    "LocationID"                
    ## [21] "QuestionID"                 "RESPID"                    
    ## [23] "GeoLocation"

## Problem 3

I will open a
